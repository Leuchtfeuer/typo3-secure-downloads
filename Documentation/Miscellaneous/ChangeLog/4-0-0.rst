==========================
Version 4.0.0 - 2019/12/03
==========================

This version is a major refactoring of former release, version `3.0.1`. It contains a lot of deprecations, but also adds a brand
new API for retrieving secured links. Beside of that, several bugs were fixed and the documentation is finally up to date.
The old, parameter-based, link generation (`?eID=secure_downloads&...`) has been removed and all links are now secured with a
`JSON Web Token <https://jwt.io>`__. However, old links are still callable when upgrading to this version.

Download
========

Download this version from the `TYPO3 extension repository <https://extensions.typo3.org/extension/secure_downloads/>`__ or from
`GitHub <https://github.com/bitmotion/typo3-secure-downloads/releases/tag/v4.0.0>`__.

Added
=====
* Dedicated Domain Transfer Object for extension configuration
* Check if `.htaccess` files are present.
* Use `JSON Web Tokens <https://jwt.io>`__ for URL generation
* PSR-15 Middleware for delivering files
* Support file delivery via nginx `x-accel-redirect`
* Wildcards for :ref:`admin-configuration-forcedownloadtype` and :ref:`admin-configuration-securedFileTypes` configuration
* Check whether configured chunk size is larger than php memory limit
* Secured files and directories can now be identified within the `filelist` module (see: :ref:`introduction-filelist`)
* URIs can now include umlauts
* Hook for manipulating response header and output function
* The file name is now present in the URL
* `Stream` option for outputting files
* Public API for getting secured URLs added (class `SecureLinkFactory`, see: Section below)
* Support for TYPO3 10.2
* Support for PHP 7.3

Getting Secured Links
---------------------
Following examples clarifies, how to retrieve secured links from different data type sources.

**Example 1:** Instance of :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\File` given:

.. code-block:: php

   /** @var \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\File $file */
   $securedUrl = $file->getPublicUrl();

**Example 2:** Instance of :php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\FileReference` given:

.. code-block:: php

   /** @var \TYPO3\CMS\Core\Resource\FileReference $fileReference */
   $securedUrl = $fileReference->getPublicUrl();

**Example 3:** Get a link that is only valid for user `19`, with user group `89`, is generated on page `12` and expires on `2022/05/08`:

.. code-block:: php

   $publicUrl = '/fileadmin/secured/invoice.pdf';
   $secureDownloadService = GeneralUtility::makeInstance(SecureDownloadService::class);
   if ($secureDownloadService->pathShouldBeSecured($publicUrl)) {
       $secureLinkFactory = GeneralUtility::makeInstance(SecureLinkFactory::class, rawurlencode($publicUrl));
       $secureLinkFactory->setUserId(29);
       $secureLinkFactory->setPageId(12);
       $secureLinkFactory->setUserGroups([89]);
       $secureLinkFactory->setLinkTimeout(1659650400);
       $securedUrl = $secureLinkFactory->getUrl();
   }
