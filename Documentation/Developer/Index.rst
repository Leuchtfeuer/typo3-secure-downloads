=============
For Developer
=============
Version 5 of this extension comes up with a lot of "microservices" that allows you to add your own
:ref:`security checks <developer-securityChecks>` and to generate your own :ref:`tokens <developer-token>`. Older and deprecated
Hooks are now available as :ref:`PSR-14 Event <developer-events>` where you can listen to. In addition, a powerful
:ref:`API <developer-securedLinks>` allows you to generate secured links in your own extension.
